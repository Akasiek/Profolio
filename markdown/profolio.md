Profolio is a name of my portfolio website which you're currently visiting.

It's an application built with Vue, Tailwind and Supabase. It's hosted on Vercel. Supabase acts as a backend which stores my blog posts and projects.
I use Markdown to write post content.

I've built it to showcase my projects and write blog posts.
