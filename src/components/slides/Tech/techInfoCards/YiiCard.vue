  <p>
    Yii is a PHP framework and it's a first PHP framework that I've used. It shares many similarities with other PHP libraries like Symphony
    or Laravel. It uses the MVC (Model-view-controller) design pattern.

    I learned Yii because of a job opportunity. The application I was to work on used this very framework. I'm currently still working with
    Yii on this application that is called
    <a href="https://neogage.com" class="default-link-white" target="_blank">NeoGage</a>. It is my first commercial coding experience. Yii
    is fun but it's not my favorite backend framework.
