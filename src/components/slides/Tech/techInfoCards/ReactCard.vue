  <p>React was my first step into reactivity. I was really excited about it but I came to the realization that there are better tools.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    I've made couple of projects in React and I found it fascinating. The reactivity was mind blowing! But the lack of official ecosystem
    cause many problems. There are many helper libraries but they do things differently and it makes coding confusing. Next.js is a solution
    to those problems but it has its own problems.
  </p>
  <p>I'll move to Vue.js as soon as possible. I think it's a better solution for me.</p>
