    <h1>Tailwind - CSS's Gone With The Wind</h1>
  </div>
  <p>
    I was sceptic about the Tailwind at first but now I cannot imagine life without it. It basically replace CSS for me. If used incorrectly
    syntax can become bloated but if used correctly... Oh&nbsp;boy...

  <p>
    Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
    <br />
    It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without
    any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.
