    I started learning because of React and my frustration with this technology. Vue just does thing better. The reactivity. The ecosystem.
    The template language. Most important things that React just lacks.

    I fell in love with Vue at first sight. I was amazed by the simplicity of the framework and the ecosystem. This portfolio is my first
    Vue project because practice makes perfect. I also chose Vue because of Nuxt - the Next.js competitor. Next.js made me frustrated with
    its indecisiveness. Nuxt looks better and more stable.
