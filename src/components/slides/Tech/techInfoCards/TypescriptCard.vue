    <h1>Typescript - Contraception for Javascript</h1>
  </div>
  <p>
    I had the same experience with Typescript as probably the 90% of people adapting to it. I fought that Typescript is mostly useless and
    Javascript is just fine for me. Oh brother... I was so very wrong.

    Everytime I can, I use Typescript now. It makes life better. It makes code better. It makes me better. I can't imagine using plain
    Javascript anymore. Fortunately, most framework nowadays use Typescript out of box or at least have a very good support for it.

  <p>Please make your life easier - use Typescript.</p>
